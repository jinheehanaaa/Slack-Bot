# Intro
- Slack bot will read my message "ping" and send message "pong" to me
- We use 3rd Party Libraries instead of direct slack API
- Socket programming is required so that bot can read/wirte messages 
- For socket programming we will use slacker created by shomali11 so we don't need to implement complicated socket programming

# Requirement
- [Generate Socket Token by enabling socket mode](https://api.slack.com/)
- [OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace](https://api.slack.com/) 
- You need to select what events you want to use (Event Subscriptions)
- You need to select what bot token scopes you want to use (OAuth & Permission)
